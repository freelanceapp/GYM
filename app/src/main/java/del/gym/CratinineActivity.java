The reason why weight gainers are so effective for this purpose is mainly due to their composition from carbohydrates, proteins and fats. The combination of the three main macronutrients allows a supplementation of weight gainers to provide between 400 and 1000 calories, depending on the way in which it is consumed daily. The mass winners are not reserved exclusively for ectomorphic people, since it is also very common to see them in the diets of many elite bodybuilders who are in the volume stage, since by their composition they have access to an exuberant consumption of calories without realizing a greater effort in the consumption of solid foods.</span></p>\n" +

The reason why weight gainers are so effective for this purpose is mainly due to their composition from carbohydrates, proteins and fats. The combination of the three main macronutrients allows a supplementation of weight gainers to provide between 400 and 1000 calories, depending on the way in which it is consumed daily. The mass winners are not reserved exclusively for ectomorphic people, since it is also very common to see them in the diets of many elite bodybuilders who are in the volume stage, since by their composition they have access to an exuberant consumption of calories without realizing a greater effort in the consumption of solid foods.</span></p>\n" +

Even during the rest days it is recommended to consume BCAA so that the muscles can receive all the necessary nutrients throughout the week, more than just when they are subjected to great efforts. Of course, these days, consumption should be lower compared to the training days, since in the latter the protein degradation is much greater and therefore, the nutritious needs are also.</span></p>"));

We know that in order for muscle to grow, in addition to proper weight training, there must also be a greater synthesis than protein degradation. If the degradation of these is higher, then there can not be an increase in muscle volume. HMB decreases the protein degradation that is fostered by high intensity training at the molecular level, through the interruption of proteolysis, a natural process that is responsible for breaking down muscle tissue after physical activity. Some studies, also developed by Dr. Nissen himself, found that after three weeks of HMB supplementation, supplemented with a training plan with loads, subjects who had never trained achieved an increase of 300% of their total lean mass, in comparison to other subjects who did not follow the same plan, but who did not receive this supplementation. Improves the consumption of fat as an energy source In the same way, other studies carried out by Nissen in 2000, showed that in addition to the evident gain of muscle mass, supplementation with HMB was also ideal for the loss of body fat. It was also found that those people who had high cholesterol could reduce the levels of LDL and total cholesterol. Accelerates muscle recovery HMB helps in the reduction of muscle damage that comes with heavy training, thus shortening recovery times after exercise. When receiving a supplement with this compound, the damage caused to the muscles is minimal, being that at the same time, the protein degradation is also significantly lower. As there is less degradation of the proteins, the stability of the muscle cell is greater and, therefore, the damage to the muscle membranes is also less. This reduction in damage to cells is measured by showing lower levels of muscle damage markers, such as creatine phosphokinase in the bloodstream. Improves strength levels A meta-analysis of resistance exercise training studies in people receiving a supplementation with HMB showed that they have a higher incidence to increase their strength levels. Clearly, it must be understood that these levels vary depending on the intensity of the training, as well as the experience in the exercises of the people studied. However, in general terms, the enhancing effect is clear. Improves resistance and VO2 max Finally, one of the benefits to be highlighted is the increase in aerobic performance in endurance athletes such as marathoners, cyclists and triathletes.</span></p>", Html.FROM_HTML_MODE_COMPACT));

If the degradation of these is higher, then there can not be an increase in muscle volume. HMB decreases the protein degradation that is fostered by high intensity training at the molecular level, through the interruption of proteolysis, a natural process that is responsible for breaking down muscle tissue after physical activity. Some studies, also developed by Dr. Nissen himself, found that after three weeks of HMB supplementation, supplemented with a training plan with loads, subjects who had never trained achieved an increase of 300% of their total lean mass, in comparison to other subjects who did not follow the same plan, but who did not receive this supplementation. Improves the consumption of fat as an energy source In the same way, other studies carried out by Nissen in 2000, showed that in addition to the evident gain of muscle mass, supplementation with HMB was also ideal for the loss of body fat. It was also found that those people who had high cholesterol could reduce the levels of LDL and total cholesterol. Accelerates muscle recovery HMB helps in the reduction of muscle damage that comes with heavy training, thus shortening recovery times after exercise. When receiving a supplement with this compound, the damage caused to the muscles is minimal, being that at the same time, the protein degradation is also significantly lower. As there is less degradation of the proteins, the stability of the muscle cell is greater and, therefore, the damage to the muscle membranes is also less. This reduction in damage to cells is measured by showing lower levels of muscle damage markers, such as creatine phosphokinase in the bloodstream. Improves strength levels A meta-analysis of resistance exercise training studies in people receiving a supplementation with HMB showed that they have a higher incidence to increase their strength levels. Clearly, it must be understood that these levels vary depending on the intensity of the training, as well as the experience in the exercises of the people studied. However, in general terms, the enhancing effect is clear. Improves resistance and VO2 max Finally, one of the benefits to be highlighted is the increase in aerobic performance in endurance athletes such as marathoners, cyclists and triathletes.</span></p>"));

Despite the great benefits that L-Carnitine can bring to the body, we must take into consideration that this is not a magic product, but a supplement and as its name implies, its function is to supplement other aspects that are involved in our transformation process. In other words, L-carnitine can only be effective when accompanied by a diet completely customized to our needs, in addition to a training plan designed individually. Consuming carnitine supplements and still carry a diet with 500 extra calories a day will only lead us to accumulate more fat, even despite the properties it develops in the body.</span></p>\n" +

A recent study carried out with overweight volunteers and published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition demonstrates such effects. conjugate seems to act to reduce body fat, while increasing muscle fat.This has been observed in several studies in which the percentage of adipose mass lost was observed. The CLA has two interesting courses of action. On the one hand, it inhibits the deposition of fat in tissues, especially in the abdominal region (decreases lipogenesis). On the other hand, it facilitates energy expenditure by increasing the destruction of fats (increase in lipolysis)</span></p>\n" +
